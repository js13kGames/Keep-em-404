TODO:
    ☐ Come up with a concept that works in AR and VR (maybe MR)
        ~ we can build/invent some game mechanics and add 
        ~ the models and theme later
    ☐ The game should work on Desktop, Mobile and VR Headset, preferably MR headset as well

Tools:
    ☐ sfx => https://github.com/mneubrand/jsfxr
    ☐ music => https://sb.bitsnbites.eu/

Ideas:    
    ☐ Tower Defence = https://www.giantbomb.com/tower-defense/3015-413/

Requirements:
    ☐ Playable in VR and AR
    ☐ Fit the theme (404)
    ☐ Fun and exiting!
    
Game ideas:
    ✘ Spartans vs Athens - 404BC @cancelled(20-08-13 23:02)
    - Get a certain amount of data to the clients.
    - tapper but with html/css/jpg etc
    - prevent bad pages to get to a client and make sure the client gets a 404     
        ~ fake news
        ~ dont have to be fake news could be more fairy-taily, like HOIP / hypnosis over IP :D
        ~ page punker
    

Why would you get a 404?:
    ☐ page not found
    ☐ aliens shot the page
    ☐ my dog ate the page
    

prevent fake news and make sure the client gets a 404:
    - how do we visualize bad pages?
    - what can we do to 'kill' bad pages

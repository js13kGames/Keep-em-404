The web browser is under attack! Evil websites are aproaching! As long as you can keep the page showing a 404 the client is fine. 

Try to place the 5 different types of towers around the world and prevent the pages to reach the browser.

The more expensive a tower the more powerfull it is. You can upgrade towers to become stronger and fight longer. 

All towers are extra efficient against a specific page:

- Shields against Ads

- First Aid agains Virusses
- Magnifier against Phishing 
- Firewall against Spyware

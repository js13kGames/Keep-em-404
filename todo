Must have:
    ✔ new design of "turtles" @done(20-08-24 23:26)
    ✔ paying for towers - when we place @done(20-08-28 00:20)
    ✔ make money - when we kill a page @done(20-08-24 23:25)    
    ✔ Remove the AR parts 😞 @done(20-08-24 23:29)
    ✔ A title screen @done(20-08-29 00:43)
    ✔ Game over screen @done(20-08-29 18:33)
    ✔ implement upgrade system @done(20-08-28 23:33)
    ✔ UI to pick towers @done(20-08-28 00:20)
    ✔ better shooting sound @done(20-09-04 21:44)
    ☐ optimize closestEnemy function
    ☐ at least! 1 interesting level
    implement waves of enemies
    ☐ balance the game
        ~ cost of individual components
        ~ fire power of towers
        ~ health of pages
        ~ enemies fight towers somehow, may shoot or damage on explosion
            or shooting has a cost of health, a tower level 1 can shoot X - level 2 y etc 
        ~ 
    ✔ add placeholder back when tower explodes @done(20-09-05 15:18)

    ✔ level storage @done(20-08-29 10:36)
    ✔ implement game over when page reaches client @done(20-08-29 18:34)
    ✔ make game start when in "PLAY" game mode @done(20-08-29 18:34)
        ~ towers already spawn on title screen

Should have:
    ✔ Visually disable towers in menu when you don't have the money @done(20-09-05 10:16)
    ☐ Visualize what is selected
    ✔ different 'hand' model @done(20-08-30 23:11)
    ☐ Rotate enemies on path
    ☐ rotate towers in direction they are shooting.
    ☐ More interesting levels
    ~ maybe use 3DSMax to create levels.
    ~ look at factorio for inspiration
    ☐ better design of TITLE
    ☐ better design of GAMEOVER
    ☐ better sounds
    
Could have:
    ✔ bullet hit explosions @done(20-09-03 21:56)
    ☐ Better Environment in VR
    ☐ flip textures on the back in the right direction, like megaphone
    ☐ Add a small random delay in the shooting of the bullets to make them go out of sync
    ☐ Particle effects when shooting
    ☐ Particle effects when upgrading
    ☐ change top texture of tower 
    ☐ music
    keep statistics on:
        ☐ how many pages killed, 
        ☐ how much spend
        ☐ how long played
    ☐ show statistics on game over screen
    
Would Like:
    ☐ Composer effect with glow

bugs:
    ☐ titlescreen disappears when switching to VR
    ✔ Towers stay after restarting @done(20-08-31 00:35)
    ✔ You can replace towers @done(20-08-31 00:35)
    ☐ Clicking with controllers is laggy
    ☐ Cursor shows on fully upgraded towers
    ☐ Lots of missing properties on components (F12-Console)
    ☐ how to call 'fire' on the title and gameover screens?
        ~ maybe 'space' on PC, 'trigger' in VR   
    ☐ fix lag spike when exploding to many enemies at once when dying
        ~ maybe limit the pool of available explosion.

Notes
    ~ zip on linux using `advzip -a -4 -i 50000 dist.zip ./dist/*.*`
    ~ use something like https://tinypng.com/ to optimize png
    ~ user Webp instead of png. try https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-webp
        ~ note that in the first test the colors.png gained 2 bytes on webp

Gameplay elements:
    towers:        
        ☐ shoots XSS
        ☐ shoots SQL-injection
        ☐ more
        ☐ firewall that can be placed in the path of the pages.
        ☐ Gui interface using VB to get an IP - blocks the server
        ☐ should be upgradable, i.e. speed, damage or more bullets
            ~ level of the tower can be shown using a different lookup color / animation
    Enemies:
        ☐ Make them appear in waves
        ✔ Add more enemy types @done(20-08-31 00:35)
    Levels:
        ☐ Add at least 5 diffent levels.
        ☐ multiple levels
        ☐ Visualize the path
    
    balance:
        - Virus                 <--> First Aid (Virus Scanner)
        - Phishing              <--> Magnifying glass (was: Honeypot)
        - Unsecure connection   <--> Certificate
        - Ads                   <--> Shield - Ad blocker
        - Spyware               <--> Firewall (was: Ricin - needles)

    ☐ World were the pages move though and where you place towers
    ✔ Start point @done(20-08-21 00:05)
    ✔ End point @done(20-08-21 00:05)
    ☐ Count the pages reaching the end    
    ✔ Scoring @done(20-08-17 21:59)
    ✔ add coloring to shader @done(20-08-21 00:05)
    ✔ animate coloring @done(20-08-21 00:05)
        ~ maybe just shift the start position

    ☐ Introduction    
    AR/VR:
        ☐ Piece of code that initializes everything based on the platform you are using.
        ☐ Place at start in AR
        ☐ UI for AR / Web
            ~ DOM-Overlay is not implemented in the allowed A-Frame version yet. 
            ~ We need to create a special UI. Which we need of VR anyway. 
        ☐ UI for VR
        ✔ Touch input should work in AR @done(20-08-21 00:05)
        ☐ Camera is different for AR and VR
            ~ VR stands in the middle and pages flow around the camera
            ~ AR is looking in from the outside
            ~ AR needs to scale down.
    ☐ Start 'page'
    ☐ End 'page'
    ☐ Visual FX
    ☐ Sound FX
    ✔ Explosions @done(20-08-28 00:39)
    ☐ Lasers
    ✔ Currency for buying towers @done(20-08-28 00:39)
    ☐ How much does shooting a page give you?
    Artwork:
        ☐ Create a color scheme and us it
        ✘ Find overall style (Cyberpunk) @cancelled(20-08-28 00:39)
        ☐ Screen shots
        ☐ logo
        ☐ description
        ☐ @critical name. 
            ideas;
                ~ keep it 404
                ~ fake news 404
                ~ don't get 200

    Implement Game States manager:
        ☐ Start menu
        ☐ Start of game
            ☐ Place start in AR
        ✔ Playing @done(20-08-28 00:39)
        ☐ Paused
        ☐ Game over
        ☐ Next Level

Story Elements:
    ☐ Fake news
    ☐ Prevent bad pages to get to innocent viewers
    ☐ Make sure they get a 404 and not the bad stuff
    ☐ Pages travel from server throught diffent routers to a client
    ☐ Towers shoot things a the pages they don't like

Random ideas:
    ☐ https://codepen.io/soulwire/pen/kqtrz
    ☐ Spawn in towers and place them by picking them up in VR and dropping them at a placeholder
    ☐ Test if base64 encoding zips the images better that png.
    ☐ Pages can drop bonus stuff you can collect to get free upgrades, or money
    ☐ maybe pages should shoot back at towers and destroy them
        ~ create 'rock, paper, siscors' like structure
    ☐ https://github.com/aframevr/a-painter/blob/master/src/components/if-no-vr-headset.js
Bugs:
    ✔ When pages are killed, sometime the tower shoots at 0,0,0 @done(20-08-28 00:39)

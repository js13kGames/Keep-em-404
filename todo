Must have:
    ✔ @critical new design of "turtles" @done(20-08-24 23:26)
    ☐ paying for towers - when we place
    ✔ make money - when we kill a page @done(20-08-24 23:25)    
    ✔ Remove the AR parts 😞 @done(20-08-24 23:29)
    ☐ A title screen
    ☐ Game over screen
    ☐ UI to pick towers
    ☐ 1 interesting level

Should have:
    ☐ bullet hit explosions
    ☐ Rotate enemies on path
    ☐ rotate towers in direction they are shooting.
    ☐ More interesting levels
        ~ maybe use 3DSMax to create levels.
        ~ look at factorio for inspiration


Could have:
    ☐ Better Environment in VR
    ☐ flip textures on the back in the right direction, like megaphone
    ☐ Add a small random delay in the shooting of the bullets to make them go out of sync
    ☐ Particle effects when shooting
    ☐ Particle effects when upgrading
    ☐ change top texture of tower 

Would Like:
    ☐ Composer effect with glow

Notes
    ~ zip on linux using `advzip -a -4 -i 50000 dist.zip ./dist/*.*`
    ~ use something like https://tinypng.com/ to optimize png

Gameplay elements:
    towers:        
        ☐ shoots XSS
        ☐ shoots SQL-injection
        ☐ more
        ☐ firewall that can be placed in the path of the pages.
        ☐ Gui interface using VB to get an IP - blocks the server
        ☐ should be upgradable, i.e. speed, damage or more bullets
            ~ level of the tower can be shown using a different lookup color / animation
    Enemies:
        ☐ Make them appear in waves
        ☐ Add more enemy types
    Levels:
        ☐ Add at leat 5 diffent levels.
        ☐ multiple levels
        ☐ Visualize the path

        - extras: Firewall


    ☐ World were the pages move though and where you place towers
    ✔ Start point @done(20-08-21 00:05)
    ✔ End point @done(20-08-21 00:05)
    ☐ Count the pages reaching the end    
    ✔ Scoring @done(20-08-17 21:59)
    ✔ add coloring to shader @done(20-08-21 00:05)
    ✔ animate coloring @done(20-08-21 00:05)
        ~ maybe just shift the start position

    ☐ Introduction    
    AR/VR:
        ☐ Piece of code that initializes everything based on the platform you are using.
        ☐ Place at start in AR
        ☐ UI for AR / Web
            ~ DOM-Overlay is not implemented in the allowed A-Frame version yet. 
            ~ We need to create a special UI. Which we need of VR anyway. 
        ☐ UI for VR
        ✔ Touch input should work in AR @done(20-08-21 00:05)
        ☐ Camera is different for AR and VR
            ~ VR stands in the middle and pages flow around the camera
            ~ AR is looking in from the outside
            ~ AR needs to scale down.
    ☐ Start 'page'
    ☐ End 'page'
    ☐ Visual FX
    ☐ Sound FX
    ☐ Explosions
    ☐ Lasers
    ☐ Currency for buying towers
    ☐ How much does shooting a page give you?
    Artwork:
        ☐ Create a color scheme and us it
        ☐ Find overall style (Cyberpunk)
        ☐ Screen shots
        ☐ logo
        ☐ description
        ☐ @critical name. 
            ideas;
                ~ keep it 404
                ~ fake news 404
                ~ don't get 200

    Implement Game States manager:
        ☐ Start menu
        ☐ Start of game
            ☐ Place start in AR
        ☐ Playing
        ☐ Paused
        ☐ Game over
        ☐ Next Level

Story Elements:
    ☐ Fake news
    ☐ Prevent bad pages to get to innocent viewers
    ☐ Make sure they get a 404 and not the bad stuff
    ☐ Pages travel from server throught diffent routers to a client
    ☐ Towers shoot things a the pages they don't like

Random ideas:
    ☐ https://codepen.io/soulwire/pen/kqtrz
    ☐ Spawn in towers and place them by picking them up in VR and dropping them at a placeholder
    ☐ Test if base64 encoding zips the images better that png.
    ☐ Pages can drop bonus stuff you can collect to get free upgrades, or money
    
Bugs:
    ☐ When pages are killed, sometime the tower shoots at 0,0,0

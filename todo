    ☐ World were the pages move though and where you place towers
    ✔ Start point @done(20-08-21 00:05)
    ✔ End point @done(20-08-21 00:05)
    ☐ Count the pages reaching the end    
    ✔ Scoring @done(20-08-17 21:59)
    ✔ add coloring to shader @done(20-08-21 00:05)

        ~ maybe just shift the start position

    ☐ Introduction    
    AR/VR:
        ☐ Piece of code that initializes everything based on the platform you are using.
        ☐ Place at start in AR
        ☐ UI for AR / Web
            ~ DOM-Overlay is not implemented in the allowed A-Frame version yet. 
            ~ We need to create a special UI. Which we need of VR anyway. 
        ☐ UI for VR
        ✔ Touch input should work in AR @done(20-08-21 00:05)
        ☐ Camera is different for AR and VR
            ~ VR stands in the middle and pages flow around the camera
            ~ AR is looking in from the outside
            ~ AR needs to scale down.
    ☐ Start 'page'
    ☐ End 'page'
    ☐ Visual FX
    ☐ Sound FX
    ☐ Explosions
    ☐ Lasers
    ☐ Currency for buying towers
    ☐ How much does shooting a page give you?
    Artwork:
        ☐ Create a color scheme and us it
        ☐ Find overall style (Cyberpunk)
        ☐ Screen shots
        ☐ logo
        ☐ description
        ☐ @critical name

    Implement Game States manager:
        ☐ Start menu
        ☐ Start of game
            ☐ Place start in AR
        ☐ Playing
        ☐ Paused
        ☐ Game over
        ☐ Next Level

Story Elements:
    ☐ Fake news
    ☐ Prevent bad pages to get to innocent viewers
    ☐ Make sure they get a 404 and not the bad stuff
    ☐ Pages travel from server throught diffent routers to a client
    ☐ Towers shoot things a the pages they don't like

Random ideas:
    ☐ https://codepen.io/soulwire/pen/kqtrz
    ☐ Spawn in towers and place them by picking them up in VR and dropping them at a placeholder
    ☐ Test if base64 encoding zips the images better that png.
    
Bugs:
    ☐ When pages are killed, sometime the tower shoots at 0,0,0
